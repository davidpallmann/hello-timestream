# Hello, Timestream!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Timestream!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-timestream) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon Timestream and time series data. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon Timestream and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to capture time series data. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Timestream Project

We will write a .NET program to capture bird sighting information in a Timestream database. For example, you might sight a California Condor in Yakima Washington. Our program will capture sightings like that, and allow them to be queried. 

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
